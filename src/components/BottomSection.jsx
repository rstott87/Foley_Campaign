              When we fight, we win! But to win, we actually need to fight. That
              means organizing actions at our job sites, which requires a
              network of well-trained and engaged stewards and leaders
              throughout the state. Our Local has only recently begun to
              prioritize our stewards. I promise that as President we will fully
              commit to training stewards and rank-and-file members to run our
              Local; to review and reverse practices that keep power and
              decision-making in the hands of the executive; to protect the
              solvency and legacy of our union; to support our members in their
              fight to secure a better living and greater security for
              themselves and their families; and to promote our Local’s values
              by supporting political candidates and legislation that advance
              economic, racial, and environmental justice in our Commonwealth.

              If you want a more strongly democratic, truly participatory,
              member-led Local, I’m your candidate. We are the union, and
              together we should lead it. As the Local’s president, I will be a
              leader who listens and acts based on the needs, the wisdom, and
              the goals of our members. In this crucial moment in labor history,
              public support for unions is higher than it's been in years, and
              workers are gaining exciting victories around the country. My
              campaign represents a movement within our Local committed to
              transparency, democracy, member involvement and fighting to win.
              Join that movement and vote for me as the next president of Local
              509.
